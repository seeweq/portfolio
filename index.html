  I live in khayelitsha with both my parents and my two siblings;<br>
  my younger brother and sister.my highest qualification is matric.<br>
  I passed my matric 2012,since i was not setisfied with my results<br>
  I went to Y2K college to improve my Science, English and Mathematics<br>
  2016 I joined a oragination called Year Beyond,this program was very<br>
  close to my heart because it gave me a opportunity to give back to the<br>
  community which was something I always wanted to do,thid disire of giving back<br>
  start when I was in Grade11,and i took three days of my life to volunteer at the community clinic.<br>
  At the end of the year beyond programme they organised a exhibition<br>
  and thats how I mate codeX and got interested on what they<br>
   where talking about because i also love solving problems.<p>
